Transactions must be signed because this is the only way in Bitcoin to guarantee that one cannot spend coins belonging to someone else.

By applying a signing algorithm to data (i.e., signing the data), one gets a signature, which can later be verified. Digital signing happens with the usage of a private key, and verification requires a public key.
In order to sign data we need the following things:
1.data to sign;
2.private key.
The operation of signing produces a signature, which is stored in transaction inputs. In order to verify a signature, the following is required:
1.data that was signed;
2.the signature;
3.public key.

Every transaction input in Bitcoin is signed by the one who created the transaction. Every transaction in Bitcoin must be verified before being put in a block.Verification means :
1.Checking that inputs have permission to use outputs from previous transactions.
2.Checking that the transaction signature is correct.


Considering that transactions unlock previous outputs, redistribute their values, and lock new outputs, the following data must be signed:

1.Public key hashes stored in unlocked outputs. This identifies “sender” of a transaction. pay attention to unlocked outputs
2.Public key hashes stored in new, locked, outputs. This identifies “recipient” of a transaction. pay attention to new locked outputs
3.Values of new outputs.
