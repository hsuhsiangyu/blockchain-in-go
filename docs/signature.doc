Transactions must be signed because this is the only way in Bitcoin to guarantee that one cannot spend coins belonging to someone else.

Considering that transactions unlock previous outputs, redistribute their values, and lock new outputs, the following data must be signed:

1.Public key hashes stored in unlocked outputs. This identifies “sender” of a transaction.
2.Public key hashes stored in new, locked, outputs. This identifies “recipient” of a transaction.
3.Values of new outputs.
