Let’s now review the full lifecycle of a transaction:

1.In the beginning, there’s the genesis block that contains a coinbase transaction. There are no real inputs in coinbase transactions, so signing is not necessary. The output of the coinbase transaction contains a hashed public key (RIPEMD16(SHA256(PubKey)) algorithms are used).
2.When one sends coins, a transaction is created. Inputs of the transaction will reference outputs from previous transaction(s). Every input will store a public key (not hashed) and a signature of the whole transaction.
3.Other nodes in the Bitcoin network that receive the transaction will verify it. Besides other things, they will check that: the hash of the public key in an input matches the hash of the referenced output (this ensures that the sender spends only coins belonging to them); the signature is correct (this ensures that the transaction is created by the real owner of the coins).
4.When a miner node is ready to mine a new block, it’ll put the transaction in a block and start mining it.
5.When the blocked is mined, every other node in the network receives a message saying the block is mined and adds the block to the blockchain.
6.After a block is added to the blockchain, the transaction is completed, its outputs can be referenced in new transactions.
