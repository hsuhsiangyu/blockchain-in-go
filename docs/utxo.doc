why do we want to have the UTXO set?
Consider the Blockchain.FindUnspentTransactions method weâ€™ve implemented earlier:
func (bc *Blockchain) FindUnspentTransactions(pubKeyHash []byte) []Transaction {
    ...
    bci := bc.Iterator()

    for {
        block := bci.Next()

        for _, tx := range block.Transactions {
            ...
        }

        if len(block.PrevBlockHash) == 0 {
            break
        }
    }
    ...
}

The function finds transactions with unspent outputs. Since transactions are stored in blocks, it iterates over each block in the blockchain and checks every transaction in it.

The solution to the problem is to have an index that stores only unspent outputs, and this is what the UTXO set does: this is a cache that is built from all blockchain transactions (by iterating over blocks, yes, but this is done only once), and is later used to calculate balance and validate new transactions.
